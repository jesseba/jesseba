- 👋 Hi, I’m @jesseba
- 👀 I’m interested in computational social choice, and the intersection of game theory, economics and algorithms. 
- 📚 My background is in molecular neuroscience and I've been working in a systems neuro lab for the past couple years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and machine learning skills! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting that I can learn new skills for all the above.
- 📫 Reach me at jesseba.fernando@gmail.com
