- 👋 Hi, I’m @jesseba
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms, network dynamics, AI, and machine learning methods and how they can be generalized across disciplines!
- 🧠 My background is in molecular neuroscience and systems neuroscience. I have experience conducting research in generalization in medical imaging AI models in the Lotter lab. Now I'm a PhD student at the Network Science Institute at Northeastern!
- 📚 I’m currently learning Python, and network analysis techniques and recently figured out how to host my own website on GitHub (jesseba.github.io)
- 🌱 I like photosynthesizing during the handful of nice weather days Boston gets
