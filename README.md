- 👋 Hi, I’m @jesseba
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms, neural nets, AI and machine learning methods and the various ways they can be applied to societal problems!
- 📚 My background is in molecular neuroscience and I've been working in a systems neuro lab for the past couple years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and machine learning skills! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting that I can learn new skills for all the above.
